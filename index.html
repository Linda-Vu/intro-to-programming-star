About:
I'm a software developer based in North Carolina. 
I have a background in sociology and visual art, but learned how to code after college and I've been working in the field ever since, starting in 2019. 
Outside of work, some of the things I enjoy doing are: cooking, trying to keep my houseplants alive, throwing pottery, and curating playlists to take baths to.

Experience:
After receiving my bachelor's degree from UNC in 2014, I spent 3.5 years managing a small business in Chapel Hill, NC. I wore a lot of hats here, including marketing, design, and website management.
This inspired me to start teaching myself how to code on the side, and eventually I committed to joining a 3-month intensive coding bootcamp in Durham, NC.
The core competencies of JavaScript, React, and Node.js that I learned from this bootcamp have remained my strongest skills.
The skills I gained from there allowed me to join a creative digital consultancy called Skookum(now known as Method). 
As a software consultant at Skookum, I was a part of many full-stack teams and had the opportunity interface with multiple clients.
Some of the projects I contributed to include:
- a developer portal for interfacing with financial APIs (Drupal, custom PHP)
- an internal tool and growth framework for in-house developers to track their competencies on various skills and technologies (React, Rails)
- a proof of concept with data visualizations for measuring air quality (Handlebars injected with React, Java)
- an admin portal for managing inventory with geolocation for construction rentals (React, Azure, .NET, C#)
- an eCommerce site for a CNC(computer numerical control) distributor (Wordpress, custom PHP)

During my time at Skookum I also hosted a recurring meetup in collabation with the Charlotte Developers network for locals to collaborate and learn JavaScript.
I also regularly contributed to our efforts of initiating a formal gameplan surrounding DEI efforts.

After approximately 2 years at Skookum, I shifted gears away from consulting to join an eCommerce startup called Carewell, as a software engineer. 
We have a team of 4 full-time engineers (including myself), and I've been able to have impact on many different initiatives.
Some of the projects I've contributed to include:
- customer facing eCommerce UI (BigCommerce, Stencil CLI, Handlebars, JavaScript)
- backend platforms services (PostgreSQL, JavaScript, Node.js, AWS)
- internal tooling for customer support employees (JavaScript, React, AWS)
- customer facing email templates (Postmark, Handlebars/Mustachio)
