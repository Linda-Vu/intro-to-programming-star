        <h1>About:</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a software developer based in North Carolina. I have a background in
          sociology and visual art, but learned how to code after college and I've
          been working in the field ever since, starting in 2019. Outside of work,
          some of the things I enjoy doing are: cooking, trying to keep my
          houseplants alive, throwing pottery, and curating playlists to do my chores to.

        <h1>Experience:</h1>
        <p>
          After receiving my bachelor's degree from UNC in 2014, I spent 3.5 years
          managing a small business in Chapel Hill, NC. I wore a lot of hats here,
          including marketing, design, and website management. This inspired me to
          start teaching myself how to code on the side, and eventually I
          committed to joining a 3-month intensive coding bootcamp in Durham, NC.

        <h2>Projects at Skookum:</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019, I joined a creative digital consultancy called Skookum(now
          known as Method). As a software consultant at here, I was a part of
          multiple full-stack scrum teams and interfaced with many
          clients.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developer portal for interfacing with financial APIs (Drupal, custom PHP)</li>
          <li>Internal tool and growth framework for in-house developers to track their competencies on various
            skills
            and technologies (React, Rails)
          </li>
          <li>Proof of concept with data visualizations for measuring air quality (Handlebars injected with React,
            Java)
          </li>
          <li>Admin portal for managing inventory with geolocation for construction rentals (React, Azure, .NET, C#)
          </li>
          <li>eCommerce site for a CNC(computer numerical control) distributor (Wordpress, custom PHP)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During my time at Skookum I also
          hosted a recurring meetup in collabation with the Charlotte Developers
          network for locals to collaborate and learn JavaScript. I also regularly
          contributed to our efforts of initiating a formal gameplan surrounding
          DEI efforts. After approximately 2 years at Skookum, I shifted gears
          away from consulting to join an eCommerce startup called Carewell, as a
          software engineer.

        <p>I joined Carewell in December 2020. We have a team of 4 full-time engineers (including
          myself), and I've been able to have impact on many different
          initiatives.
        </p>
