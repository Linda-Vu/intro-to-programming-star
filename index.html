    <h1>About:</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a software developer based in North Carolina. I have a background in
      sociology and visual art, but learned how to code after college and I've
      been working in the field ever since, starting in 2019. Outside of work,
      some of the things I enjoy doing are: cooking, trying to keep my
      houseplants alive, throwing pottery, and curating playlists to do my chores to.

    <h1>Experience:</h1>
    <p>
      After receiving my bachelor's degree from UNC in 2014, I spent 3.5 years
      managing a small business in Chapel Hill, NC. I wore a lot of hats here,
      including marketing, design, and website management. This inspired me to
      start teaching myself how to code on the side, and eventually I
      committed to joining a 3-month intensive coding bootcamp in Durham, NC.

    <p>
      After this, I joined a creative digital consultancy called Skookum(now
      known as Method). As a software consultant at Skookum, I was a part of
      multiple full-stack teams and interfaced with many
      clients.
    </p>
    <h2>Some of the projects I contributed to include:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>a developer portal for interfacing with financial APIs (Drupal, custom PHP)</li>
      <li>an internal tool and growth framework for in-house developers to track their competencies on various skills
        and technologies (React, Rails)
      </li>
      <li>a proof of concept with data visualizations for measuring air quality (Handlebars injected with React, Java)
      </li>
      <li>an admin portal for managing inventory with geolocation for construction rentals (React, Azure, .NET, C#)</li>
      <li>an eCommerce site for a CNC(computer numerical control) distributor (Wordpress, custom PHP)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During my time at Skookum I also
      hosted a recurring meetup in collabation with the Charlotte Developers
      network for locals to collaborate and learn JavaScript. I also regularly
      contributed to our efforts of initiating a formal gameplan surrounding
      DEI efforts. After approximately 2 years at Skookum, I shifted gears
      away from consulting to join an eCommerce startup called Carewell, as a
      software engineer.
    </p>
    <p>At Carewell, we have a team of 4 full-time engineers (including
      myself), and I've been able to have impact on many different
      initiatives.
    </p>
